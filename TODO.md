# TODO ðŸš§

Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try editing the codeâ€“add a button element that moves when the user clicks it.

In `script.j`, I will need to add and subtract how much money the player(s) win or looses as the play the game. They will also need to be able enter their name when playing the game.

In `style.css` I need to create a better look over all for the page.

## Keep going! ðŸš€
